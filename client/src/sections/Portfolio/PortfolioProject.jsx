            The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a flutter
            of the sails, and was at rest. The flood had made, the wind was
            nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it
            was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide.

            The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning
            of an interminable waterway. In the offing the sea and the sky were
            welded together without a joint, and in the luminous space the
            tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to stand
            still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of
            varnished sprits. A haze rested on the low shores that ran out to
            sea in vanishing flatness. The air was dark above Gravesend, and
            farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom, brooding
            motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.

            The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four
            affectionately watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to
            seaward. On the whole river there was nothing that looked half so
            nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is trustworthiness
            personified. It was difficult to realize his work was not out there
            in the luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.

            “Mind,” he began again, lifting one arm from the elbow, the palm of
            the hand outwards, so that, with his legs folded before him, he had
            the pose of a Buddha preaching in European clothes and without a
            lotus-flower—“Mind, none of us would feel exactly like this. What
            saves us is efficiency—the devotion to efficiency. But these chaps
            were not much account, really. They were no colonists; their
            administration was merely a squeeze, and nothing more, I suspect.
            They were conquerors, and for that you want only brute force—nothing
            to boast of, when you have it, since your strength is just an
            accident arising from the weakness of others. They grabbed what they
            could get for the sake of what was to be got. It was just robbery
            with violence, aggravated murder on a great scale, and men going at
            it blind—as is very proper for those who tackle a darkness. The
            conquest of the earth, which mostly means the taking it away from
            those who have a different complexion or slightly flatter noses than
            ourselves, is not a pretty thing when you look into it too much.
            What redeems it is the idea only. An idea at the back of it; not a
            sentimental pretence but an idea; and an unselfish belief in the
            idea—something you can set up, and bow down before, and offer a
            sacrifice to….”

            He broke off. Flames glided in the river, small green flames, red
            flames, white flames, pursuing, overtaking, joining, crossing each
            other—then separating slowly or hastily. The traffic of the great
            city went on in the deepening night upon the sleepless river. We
            looked on, waiting patiently—there was nothing else to do till the
            end of the flood; but it was only after a long silence, when he
            said, in a hesitating voice, “I suppose you fellows remember I did
            once turn fresh-water sailor for a bit,” that we knew we were fated,
            before the ebb began to run, to hear about one of Marlow’s
            inconclusive experiences.

            “I don’t want to bother you much with what happened to me
            personally,” he began, showing in this remark the weakness of many
            tellers of tales who seem so often unaware of what their audience
            would like best to hear; “yet to understand the effect of it on me
            you ought to know how I got out there, what I saw, how I went up
            that river to the place where I first met the poor chap. It was the
            farthest point of navigation and the culminating point of my
            experience. It seemed somehow to throw a kind of light on everything
            about me—and into my thoughts. It was sombre enough, too—and
            pitiful—not extraordinary in any way—not very clear either. No, not
            very clear. And yet it seemed to throw a kind of light.

            “I had then, as you remember, just returned to London after a lot of
            Indian Ocean, Pacific, China Seas—a regular dose of the East—six
            years or so, and I was loafing about, hindering you fellows in your
            work and invading your homes, just as though I had got a heavenly
            mission to civilize you. It was very fine for a time, but after a
            bit I did get tired of resting. Then I began to look for a ship—I
            should think the hardest work on earth. But the ships wouldn’t even
            look at me. And I got tired of that game, too.

            “Now when I was a little chap I had a passion for maps. I would look
            for hours at South America, or Africa, or Australia, and lose myself
            in all the glories of exploration. At that time there were many
            blank spaces on the earth, and when I saw one that looked
            particularly inviting on a map (but they all look that) I would put
            my finger on it and say, ‘When I grow up I will go there.’ The North
            Pole was one of these places, I remember. Well, I haven’t been there
            yet, and shall not try now. The glamour’s off. Other places were
            scattered about the hemispheres. I have been in some of them, and…
            well, we won’t talk about that. But there was one yet—the biggest,
            the most blank, so to speak—that I had a hankering after.
